## Origin and Dreams

Luffy's journey began in the East Blue, where he consumed the Gum-Gum Fruit, a Devil Fruit that granted him rubber-like powers but rendered him unable to swim. Despite this weakness, Luffy set out to become the Pirate King, inspired by his childhood idol, Gol D. Roger. His dream is to find the One Piece, the ultimate treasure that will grant him the title of the Pirate King and allow him to become the freest person on the seas.

8. Brook: A living skeleton musician who provides entertainment and swordsmanship.
